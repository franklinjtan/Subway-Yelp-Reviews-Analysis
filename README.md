# Subway Yelp Reviews Analysis

## Summary
* Created a set of analyses that support or disprove the following statements made by company leadership:
  * Head of Customer Service: “Our ratings are gradually improving, and we will soon reach 4.5/5.”
    * The data does not support the statement made by the Head of Customer Service. In fact, average ratings by year show average ratings declining during the same timeline. We can also see the total ratings received increase during those years.
  * Head of Store Operations: “Sandwiches are a tricky business. All sandwich chains suffer from poor customer ratings.”
  * Head of Social Media: “The goal of 4.5/5 is unreasonable for national chains like us. Only small, local, and boutique restaurants can achieve such high ratings.”
  * Chief Data Scientist: “It is well known that customers make the effort to give a rating only when they are either extremely angry or absolutely delighted with the service. So online ratings are not reliable.”
* Yelp Datasets used in the analysis: reviews.csv and restaurants.csv
